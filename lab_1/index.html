    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Prince Jeff Muturi. I came to the United States 10 years ago when I was turning 10. I was born and raised in Kenya, and I visit there once or twice a year with my family.</p>  <!-- creates a paragraph of text -->

    <h2>Renton Tech and the CS Program</h2>
    <p>I recently moved to Washington, and I have always loved working with technology. So, it was a no-brainer that I would pursue a career in computers, although I'm not great at it, I'm always excited to learn. I chose Renton Technical College due to its proximity to my new location and the positive reviews I found online.</p>

    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <p>After completing the CS program at RTC, I hope to find a job in the technology industry. This is the job that I want when I'm done with school:</p>
